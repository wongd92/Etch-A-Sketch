# Etch-A-Sketch

HTML/CSS/JavaScript Project - Etch-A-Sketch

- Project was to re-create a similar version to the physical toy Etch-A-Sketch
- Focus was on JavaScript DOM manipulation to create the game elements 
- Skills: CSS Grid, Viewport styling, min/max width/height CSS styling, button events, DOM manipulation focus (practiced creating elements with DOM)

Reflection for project: 
- Much more comfortable with event listeners and arrow functions in JavaScript
- Improved problem solving process with research, testing code and optimizing functions
- Tried new methods of CSS styling with viewports and creating button animations
- Looking forward to practicing responsive web design in future projects
